# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied After Many Component Instances

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS where classes cease to be applied after a large number of component instances are rendered. This issue is usually related to performance or build process limitations, not necessarily a direct error in the code.

## Bug Description
The provided `MyComponent` uses standard Tailwind CSS classes. When many instances are rendered on the page, the styling from these classes suddenly stops being applied for some of the components.  The number at which the breakage happens depends on the complexity of the component and the overall page performance. The issue is reproducible only after reaching a large number of rendered components.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4.  Observe the styling of the components after a certain number of instances.
